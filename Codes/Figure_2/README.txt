Summary:
Depicts the mean timecourses of perceived and not perceived trials for all above threshold icEEG/thalamic channels and from the Pz ldEEG scalp channel.

# Figure 2F

Summary:
Bar graph of the mean first peak latency from the ldEEG data (contacts Oz â€“ mean of O1 and O2, Cz, and Pz) and icEEG/thalamic data (above threshold channels). Statistically significant results are shown with an asterisk by Wilcoxon rank sum tests
