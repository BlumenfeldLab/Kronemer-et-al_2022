Figure 5A and B

Summary:
Statistically significant voxel t-values found on interstimulus interval (ISI) perceived minus not perceived report spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation tests.

Summary: 
Statistically significant voxel t-values found on no-report versus interstimulus interval (ISI), perceived minus not perceived report spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation tests.

Figure 5E and F

Summary:
This result shows the conjunction of dissimilar regions from the following analyses: No-report vs pupil sorted, no-report vs blink sorted, and no-report vs microsaccade sorted.
