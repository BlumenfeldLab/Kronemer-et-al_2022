# Figure 3A and B

Summary:
Statistically significant voxel t-values by spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation tests found for report perceived minus not perceived. Final visualization is made with MRIcron (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron).

# Figure 3C and D

Summary:
Statistically significant voxel t-values by spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation tests found for no-report perceived minus not perceived. Final visualization is made with MRIcron (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron).

# Figure 3E and F

Summary:
Conjunction regions for positive (green) and negative (violet) voxels comparing statistically significant report and no-report conditions of perceived minus not perceived fMRI dynamics from Figure 3A, B, C, and D. Final visualization is made with MRIcron (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron).
